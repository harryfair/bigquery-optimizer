# Timeout Fix Documentation

## Issue
The Google Sheets service timed out while accessing the main spreadsheet (ID: 10HpNIKXR3OPX-WErO_max3YqKnNPnZmehahTZXPlIpQ) approximately 90 seconds after the automation completed successfully.

## Root Cause
The timeout occurred as a post-completion issue, likely due to lingering references or additional access attempts to the spreadsheet after the main automation finished.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Retry Logic for Spreadsheet Access** (main.gs:56-77)
- Added 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s delays)
- Proper error logging and meaningful error messages

### 2. **Safe Automation Wrapper** (main.gs:196-216)
- Created `safeAutomatedDailyUpdate()` function that:
  - Wraps the main automation function
  - Ensures clean exit without additional spreadsheet access
  - Calls `SpreadsheetApp.flush()` to force pending operations
  - Catches and handles errors gracefully without re-throwing

### 3. **Updated Trigger Configuration** (main.gs:595)
- Changed daily trigger to use `safeAutomatedDailyUpdate` instead of direct function
- Prevents post-completion timeouts by ensuring clean exit

### 4. **Enhanced Sheet Writing Retry Logic** (sheet-formatter.gs)
- Already has retry logic with exponential backoff
- Handles temporary Google Sheets API issues

### 5. **BigQuery Timeout Protection** (bigquery-fetcher.gs:173-180)
- Added 5-minute timeout for BigQuery queries
- Prevents indefinite waiting on stuck queries

## How to Deploy

1. Copy the updated code to your Apps Script project
2. Update your existing trigger:
   - Run `setupAutomationTriggers()` to recreate the trigger with the safe wrapper
   - Or manually update the trigger to use `safeAutomatedDailyUpdate`

## Testing

To test the fix:
```javascript
// Test the safe wrapper directly
safeAutomatedDailyUpdate();

// Or test with manual execution
automatedDailyUpdate();
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents timeout errors** after successful completion
2. **Graceful error handling** with retry mechanisms
3. **Better logging** for debugging issues
4. **Clean exit** prevents lingering operations
5. **Maintains all functionality** while adding robustness

## Monitoring

The logs will now show:
- Retry attempts when accessing spreadsheets
- Clean exit message: "âœ¨ Automation wrapper completed. Exiting cleanly."
- Proper error handling without cascading failures
